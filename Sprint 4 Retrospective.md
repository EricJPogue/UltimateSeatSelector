The team is making great strides on work that is being done. We finally have a Node.js site functioning in both test and production environments. 
We have been consistenly meeting and made the most progress thus far in our previous sprint to be able to move forward. 
We have noticed that meeting as a team with the instructor proved to be the most beneficial, but difficult to coordinate. 
Our current most important task is to continue working on the proper function calls that gets our production working.
