Review Session:
The team is making great strides on work that is being done. We have a lot of the functionality committed to done in one instance. 
Our biggest hope going into the next sprint is to have the CSS worked out and continue to get our database integrated and working. 
All current stories tagged as done are committed to production. We are very pleased with the current state of the product. We demoed during this session
a rough sketch of our CSS. The final CSS will be done by the end of Sprint 6. This was originally discussed on March 29th by Nic, Ian, James, and Joe.

Demo Feedback:
Some of the feedback we got was Matt curious as to how we came up with our idea for authentication as they themselves are stuck on their own authentication aspects.

One thing they would like for a future full program is the ability to have multiple classrooms. We mentioned that at least for this project it is to emulate the room layout from Sprint 1.

They were curious as to how long someone is expected to use this application, will it be a day-to-day update or something more permanent? We mentioned that the teacher can dictate how often an update would need to occur once the database is implemented as it currently is day-to-day.

They were curious about the screen splitting and not sure how much they actually liked that but said it was not much of a problem currently.

Currently, if a student enters a null entry the seat gets filled with a blank student, they said that needs to be fixed.

Brandon mentioned he wishes it had a more elegant layout with better CSS, I mentioned to him the CSS was currently being worked on. 

They wish that it was saved when refreshing the page. They also ran into this issue as their databases are not fully up and running.

They both really enjoyed how easy the program was to pick up and use with no real issue with getting the functions to run. The layout was nice and they said in the future if we need more testing done they will help.
