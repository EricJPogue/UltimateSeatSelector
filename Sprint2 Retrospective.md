Team is working well together to make sure that all memebers understand tasks and put forth best effort. We have
a solid meeting schedule to collaborate and ensure that everyone gets the support we need. Communication has been
highly effective in allowing for us to meet all deadlines. We are making sure everyone is accountable for their work.
One thing we need to do better would be to plan our next sprint earlier, one thing that could help support this is if 
the next sprint information was released prior to end of the previous sprint.
