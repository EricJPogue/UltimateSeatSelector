The team is working well to make sure all members are being updated consistently on work that is being done. We have a great schedule for when we collaborate and meet to ensure
we are supporting each other as best as we can. We have noticed that meeting as a team with the instructor proved to be the most beneficial, but difficult to coordinate. 
Our current most important task is still properly setting up the node.js site to ensure we are properly running a hosted page. From there we will implement the 
correct function calls.
