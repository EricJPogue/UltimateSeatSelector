Review Session: The team has done a great job with the work we have committed. We have a lot of the functionality committed to done. We have the CSS worked out and are continuing to work on getting our database integrated and working. 
All current stories tagged as done are committed to production. We are very pleased with the current state of the product. This was originally discussed on April 12th by Nic, Ian, James, and Joe.

Demo Delivered: Ian and Nic both delivered a demo this sprint to the team and the professor. They each demoed a different page on the CSS that was completed.
The first page was on the authentication page and how the code worked to put everything in place. The other was the CSS of the actual seat selector page itself
and how all the seats were orientated.
