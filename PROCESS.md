To get started with the process of Scrum we have assigned us the Scrum roles for the four of us. Our experience with Scrum is that of a basic academic level, 
but we are looking forward to putting what we have learned into action with this course. When assigning the roles of Product Owner, Scrum Master, and 
Development Team Members. We are more getting a feel as to what feels comfortable for our team. Which makes this more of a test run for us rather than 
cementing in the roles. Though that is what this course, and Scrum, is all about. Cycling through the roles and gathering the experience from them is 
what we as a team need to grow in becoming more efficient for outputting this product.

In order to achieve this growth, we are having weekly meetings on Tuesday evenings to make sure that we have met our progress requirements for that sprint. 
That will have the team stay on track to delivering a successful product. This being the first sprint, we are more focused on developing an approach for this 
product so that we have a solid plan for our final deployment.
