Process:
We host all of our sites from Azure. Additionally, our test site (only available to developers) and 
product site (publically available) are available from our main page. Everytime we make a complete 
update, we will add it to the product site for users to test our new features.

New Team Members:
Access to the newest source code is available here in this repository. The links to our contact information
are in our readme and teams files. Additionally, the link to the product is in the readme.

New Customers:
Our active website link is available in our readme file. For inquiries and comments, feel free to reach out 
to us (contact info in our teams and readme files).


This site was built based on the contents of our [README.md](https://github.com/EricJPogue/UltimateSeatSelector/blob/main/README.md)
