Process:
As of now our process for updating any of the sites is to do our own testing on our local repos. Then decide on one we
want to use and upload our code to our test branch. From there we then hand it over to a dev that has access to a repo
with the Azure website linked to it. Than upload the code into the dev repo to have it be visable on the site. We than
test out the features we implement and make sure that they match up with our testing data from our local repo. If
everything works than that is our process. As for how we upload to production, it uses the same steps as test. 
Just the starting point is from the testing branch, instead of our local repos.

This is the current process but this can change. The reason we are doing this weird workaround with an additional repo.
is because we are not the owners of the repo and given how we were taught in making the Azure website. We need to be 
the owners in order for it to operate as intended. If we find a more efficent way to do it, than we will implement it.

We have implemented a password system from the initial homepage to our seat selector. If the students do not present the correct password it will leave them on that page. 

We are planning on making JS function calls from our HTML to javascript files to allow for events to occur on our site. Currently we have the ability to choose a seat,
attend virtually, and enter user information.

Added CSS to make a more elegant looking page that shows seat icons and the layout of the room. 

New Team Members:
Access to the newest source code is available here in this repository. The branches are for test and production. 
Those branches corespond to the test and production sites. 
The links to our contact information and the sites are in our readme file.

New Customers:
Our active website links are available in our readme file. Production is meant for client use. While Test is meant for
devlopers and client admins to test out the site. For inquiries and comments, feel free to reach out 
to us (contact info in our teams and readme files).
